        <p>I am a full stack web developer in the Raleigh, NC area. I enjoy 
          building simple and accessible websites and finding creative solutions 
          to difficult programming problems. In my free time I like to exercise, 
          spend time with my dog and garden. Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
          Feel free to contact me at the phone number or email on the contact page.
